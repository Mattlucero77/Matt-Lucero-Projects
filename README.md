[Provide Objective - Remove this afterwards]]

After my studies in college and working in the phartmaceutical sector, I decided to take some courses related to the CompTIA Network+ as well as CompTIA Security+ to broaden my knwoledge and to see if I had an interest in IT and cybersecurity. After gaining my Security+ and performing home labs & projects for applicable experience, I am now eager to transition into the field, specifically aiming to join an organization's IT service department or a role pertaining to network administration.
